  // REVIEW: If your template will use properties that aren't on the object yet, add them.
  // Since your template can't hold any JS logic, we need to execute the logic here.
  // The result is added to the object as a new property, which can then be referenced by key in the template.
  // For example, you might want to display how old a post is, or say "(draft)" if it has no publication date:
  this.daysAgo = parseInt((new Date() - new Date(this.publishedOn))/60/60/24/1000);


  this.publishStatus = this.publishedOn ? `published ${this.daysAgo} days ago` : '(draft)';

  //   this.publishStatus = `published ${this.daysAgo} days ago`;

// COMMENT: Why are there parentheses around "(a,b)" in the .sort() method, but not around the "articleObject" or "article" arguments in the .forEach() methods?
//The .sort() method can pass 2 params so it needs to contain them in parens. The .forEach() method can only pass 1 param so it does not NEED parens, however having parens around a single param is kosher as well.

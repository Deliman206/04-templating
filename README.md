**Author**: Cara and Sean
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
The applicaton is a blog of articles where the user can filter articles by either author or category. The user is not exposed to too much content at what time and is allowed to see a teaser and find more information if desired. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
User needs to have knowledge of HTML templating for how they want the data to display. jQuery knowledge and knowing how to traverse the DOM and load the needed parts into the template. 

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
This application uses a little of CSS, two libraries: Handlebars and jQuery. Also uses HTML and javascript.
